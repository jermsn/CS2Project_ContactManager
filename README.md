# CS2Project_ContactManager
Repository for Spring 2018 Computer Science 2 project.

This is a Las Positas Spring 2018 project to develop a C++ based contact manager.
This project will store contacts of the following types (all of which inherit from a base 'Contact' class)
- PersonalContact
- WorkContact

Future efforts will include writing to a binary file an implementing a linked list for STL compatibility.
