# CS2Project_ContactManager
Repository for Spring 2018 Computer Science 2 project.

This is a Las Positas Spring 2018 project to develop a C++ based contact manager.
This project will store contacts of the following types (all of which inherit from a base 'Contact' class)
- PersonalContact
- WorkContact
- ClientContact
- RelativeContact

The following concepts covered this semester have been implemented:
- Input validation for user defined types: Dates and Phone Numbers
- Exception handling: Dates give specific error messages for exceptions 


Future efforts will include writing to a binary file an implementing a linked list for STL compatibility.
